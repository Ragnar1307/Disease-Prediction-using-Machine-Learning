# Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Now-a-days, people face various diseases due to the environmental condition and their living habits.
So the prediction of disease at earlier stage becomes important task. But the accurate prediction on the basis of symptoms becomes too difficult for doctor. The correct prediction of disease is the most challenging task. To overcome this problem data mining plays an important role to predict the disease.
Medical science has large amount of data growth per year.
Due to increase amount of data growth in medical and healthcare field the accurate analysis on medical data which has been benefits from early patient care.
With the help of disease data, data mining finds hidden pattern information in the huge amount of medical data.
Machine Learning is an emerging approach that helps in prediction, diagnosis of a disease.
Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest are employed on the provided dataset and predict the disease.
